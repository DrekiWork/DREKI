    Uh-oh! Something went awry - <em>don't worry</em>, it's probably not game breaking... but just in case, put your save file and a description of what you were doing up on the GitHub. <br>
    Call: 
    <<switch _args[0]>>
        <<case "buildQueueWeird">>
            The build queue tried to build something that doesn't exist!<br>
            Item name: <<print $buildQueue[0]>>.
        <<default>>
            Whoops! Not sure. Please let Recila know what you were up to and they should be able to figure it out.
