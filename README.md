# DREKI

You are a dragon, building up a colony from nothing after leaving your home. Currently, there isn't a lot... but you knew that already, didn't you?

This is / was an exercise in creating a basic colony sim that ballooned quite rapidly into a rather ambitious project! It's very much still in progress; feedback on architecture, code, writing, and basically everything is always, <em>always</em> appreciated.
